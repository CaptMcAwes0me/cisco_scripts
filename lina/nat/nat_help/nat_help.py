    Lina "NAT" Commands Help
    =======================

    1. **show running-config all nat**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration related to NAT (Network Address Translation).  
       - Useful for reviewing and verifying the entire NAT setup on the system, ensuring the correct mappings between 
       private and public IP addresses.

    2. **show nat detail**  
       - Provides detailed information about the NAT configuration.  
       - Shows how individual NAT rules are set up, including translations and address pools in use, helping to 
       troubleshoot or optimize NAT behavior.

    3. **show nat proxy-arp**  
       - Displays the proxy ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) configuration for NAT.  
       - Helps in diagnosing issues related to NAT when proxy ARP is used, allowing devices on the network to respond to
        ARP requests on behalf of other devices.

    4. **show nat pool**  
       - Displays the NAT pools configured on the system.  
       - Shows the range of IP addresses available for NAT translation, which is essential for ensuring enough IP 
       addresses are available for outbound connections.

    5. **show xlate count**  
       - Displays the count of active NAT translations.  
       - Helps in monitoring the number of translations currently in use, which can be useful for troubleshooting 
       overload or resource limitations.

    6. **show xlate detail**  
       - Displays detailed information about NAT translations.  
       - Provides in-depth data on each active translation, including source and destination addresses, ports, and the 
       current status of the translation.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all nat** command provides the full NAT configuration, while the **show nat detail** 
    command offers a closer look at individual NAT rules and translations.

    - The **show nat proxy-arp** command is used specifically for scenarios where proxy ARP is involved, while the 
    **show nat pool** command helps verify the available address pools for NAT.

    - The **show xlate count** and **show xlate detail** commands are particularly useful for monitoring and 
    troubleshooting active NAT translations, helping to track the current state of connections and identify any 
    potential issues with translation resources.
