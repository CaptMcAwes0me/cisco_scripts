    Lina "show cluster" Commands Help
    ================================

    1. **show running-config all cluster**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration for the cluster.  
       - Useful for reviewing cluster-wide settings and verifying configurations.

    2. **show cluster info**  
       - Shows detailed information about the cluster.  
       - Indicates the cluster member limit and provides a note: the cluster should be configured to match the number of
        units in the cluster.  
       - Helps ensure that the cluster is properly scaled and aligned with the configuration limits.

    3. **show nat pool cluster**  
       - Displays the NAT pool configuration for the cluster.  
       - Allows administrators to review the configured NAT pools and ensure proper address translation is in place for 
       cluster members.

    4. **show cluster resource usage**  
       - Shows the current resource usage within the cluster.  
       - Helps track resource consumption (CPU, memory, etc.) to ensure the cluster is operating within capacity and to 
       identify potential bottlenecks.

    5. **show mtu**  
       - Displays the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) settings.  
       - Important note: the cluster CCL (Cluster Control Link) should be configured to be at least 100 bytes larger 
       than the data interface MTU to avoid fragmentation and ensure proper communication between cluster members.

    6. **show cluster conn count**  
       - Displays the connection count for the cluster.  
       - Helps track the number of connections currently being handled by the cluster, which is useful for monitoring 
       cluster load and performance.

    7. **show cluster xlate count**  
       - Displays the count of NAT translations in the cluster.  
       - Helps track the number of active translations being handled, useful for identifying scaling issues or unusually
        high translation loads.

    8. **show cluster traffic**  
       - Displays the traffic statistics for the cluster.  
       - Provides insights into the cluster's throughput, including data transfer rates and any traffic-related 
       performance issues.

    9. **show cluster cpu**  
       - Displays CPU usage statistics for the cluster.  
       - Useful for monitoring the performance of cluster members and identifying any CPU-intensive processes or 
       imbalances within the cluster.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all cluster** and **show cluster info** commands provide key configuration and 
    operational details about the cluster, ensuring it's properly configured and scaled.

    - The **show nat pool cluster** and **show cluster resource usage** commands are useful for monitoring NAT resources
     and tracking cluster resource consumption, respectively.

    - The **show mtu** command ensures that the cluster's control link is properly sized in relation to the data 
    interface MTU, preventing potential fragmentation issues.

    - The **show cluster conn count**, **show cluster xlate count**, **show cluster traffic**, and **show cluster cpu** 
    commands help monitor the overall load and performance of the cluster, focusing on connections, translations, 
    traffic, and CPU usage.
