    1. **show running-config all snmp**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration related to SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).  
       - Useful for reviewing and verifying SNMP settings across the system to ensure proper monitoring and management.

    2. **show snmp-server engineID**  
       - Displays the SNMP server engine ID.  
       - The engine ID uniquely identifies the SNMP engine on the system, which is important for SNMPv3 authentication 
       and ensuring the integrity of communication.

    3. **show snmp-server group**  
       - Displays the SNMP server groups configured on the system.  
       - Helps in identifying which SNMP groups are set up, which defines the access rights and security model for SNMP 
       users.

    4. **show snmp-server host**  
       - Displays the SNMP server host information.  
       - Shows the details of the SNMP managers or hosts configured to receive SNMP traps and notifications from the 
       system.

    5. **show snmp-server user**  
       - Displays the SNMP user configuration.  
       - Useful for verifying SNMPv3 user configurations, including authentication and privacy settings, ensuring secure
        access to SNMP data.

    6. **show snmp-server statistics**  
       - Displays SNMP statistics.  
       - Provides information about SNMP protocol operations and events, which can be useful for troubleshooting and 
       verifying SNMP communication.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all snmp** command provides a complete overview of SNMP configuration, while the other 
    commands dive deeper into specific SNMP components, like engine ID, groups, hosts, users, and statistics.

    - The **show snmp-server engineID** and **show snmp-server group** commands help verify the SNMP engine and group 
    settings, ensuring the proper structure for SNMPv3 communication.

    - The **show snmp-server host** and **show snmp-server user** commands focus on verifying the SNMP targets and user 
    configurations, ensuring that SNMP traps are directed correctly and that the right users have access to SNMP data.

    - The **show snmp-server statistics** command helps in monitoring SNMP activity and can help troubleshoot any issues
     in the SNMP communication process.
