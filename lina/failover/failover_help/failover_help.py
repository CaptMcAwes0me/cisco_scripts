    Lina "Failover" Commands Help
    ============================

    1. **show running-config all failover**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration for the failover settings.  
       - Useful for reviewing and verifying the failover configuration across the system, ensuring proper redundancy and
        fault tolerance.

    2. **show failover state**  
       - Displays the current state of the failover system.  
       - Shows whether the system is in an active or standby state, indicating which unit is currently processing 
       traffic and which is on standby.

    3. **show failover**  
       - Displays basic failover information.  
       - Provides a quick overview of the failover status, including whether the failover process is currently 
       functional and any relevant operational details.

    4. **show failover details**  
       - Displays detailed information about the failover system.  
       - Provides deeper insights into failover events, configuration synchronization, and other failover-related metrics.

    5. **show failover interface**  
       - Displays the failover interfaces in the system.  
       - Shows which interfaces are dedicated to failover communication and ensures they are properly configured for 
       the failover process.

    6. **show failover descriptor**  
       - Displays the failover descriptor configuration.  
       - Provides information on how the failover system is described and managed, including specific parameters that 
       influence failover behavior.

    7. **show failover config-sync status**  
       - Displays the configuration synchronization status for failover.  
       - Ensures that the failover units are synchronized in terms of configuration, which is critical for a smooth 
       failover process in case of failure.

    8. **show failover app-sync status**  
       - Displays the application synchronization status for failover.  
       - Shows whether the failover units are synchronized in terms of application states and data, ensuring that the 
       standby unit can seamlessly take over in case of failure.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all failover**, **show failover state**, and **show failover** commands provide an 
    overview of the failover systemâ€™s status and configuration, ensuring that redundancy is in place and operational.

    - The **show failover details**, **show failover interface**, and **show failover descriptor** commands give more 
    granular details, helping to troubleshoot and verify the failover process, including interface configuration and 
    failover behavior.

    - The **show failover config-sync status** and **show failover app-sync status** commands ensure that both 
    configuration and application states are properly synchronized between the failover units, ensuring a smooth 
    transition in case of failover events.
