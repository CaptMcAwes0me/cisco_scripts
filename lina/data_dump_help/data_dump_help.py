    Data Dump Menu Help:

    The Data Dump Menu provides various commands to extract and review detailed system information, 
    aiding in diagnostics and troubleshooting.

    1. **Device Information**: 
       - Retrieves essential device details, including system version, uptime, hardware specifications, 
         and active configurations.

    2. **NAT (Network Address Translation) Dump**: 
       - Gathers comprehensive NAT-related data, including active translations, pool allocations, 
         and NAT rule configurations.

    3. **Connectivity and Traffic**: 
       - Provides network connectivity statistics, active connections, and traffic flow details. 
         Useful for analyzing packet transmission, congestion, or dropped connections.

    4. **Routing**: 
       - Dumps routing tables and protocol-specific information to analyze path selection, 
         adjacency details, and route propagation.

    5. **VPN**: 
       - Collects data on active VPN sessions, encryption parameters, and tunnel states for 
         troubleshooting secure connections.

    6. **High Availability (HA) / Failover**: 
       - Dumps HA and failover-related information, including sync status, failover state, 
         and interface health, ensuring redundancy is functioning properly.

    7. **Logging and Monitoring**: 
       - Extracts system logs, real-time monitoring statistics, and performance metrics 
         for debugging and auditing purposes.

    8. **Clustering**: 
       - Retrieves clustering details, including member status, load distribution, 
         and resource allocation within a clustered environment.

    9. **Block Memory**: 
       - Dumps memory block statistics, tracking usage, exhaustion events, and 
         potential memory leaks affecting performance.

    **How These Options Help**:

    - **Device Information & NAT Dump** provide general system and network translation insights.
    - **Connectivity & Routing Dumps** help analyze network flow and potential issues.
    - **VPN & HA/Failover Dumps** focus on secure connectivity and redundancy mechanisms.
    - **Logging & Clustering Dumps** assist with monitoring and performance analysis.
    - **Block Memory Dump** aids in low-level memory diagnostics.

    Use these commands to extract vital diagnostic information and analyze system behavior efficiently.
