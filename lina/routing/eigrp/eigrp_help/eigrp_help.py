    Lina "EIGRP" Commands Help
    ==========================

    1. **show running-config all router eigrp**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration for EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  
       - Useful for reviewing the full EIGRP configuration, including the router settings, network advertisements, and neighbor relationships.

    2. **show eigrp events**  
       - Displays the events related to the EIGRP protocol.  
       - Helps track EIGRP-related events such as route updates, route changes, and state transitions, aiding in troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

    3. **show eigrp interfaces**  
       - Displays information about EIGRP interfaces.  
       - Provides details of the interfaces participating in EIGRP, such as the interface status, IP addresses, and EIGRP metrics, which helps verify and troubleshoot EIGRP operations.

    4. **show eigrp neighbors**  
       - Displays information about EIGRP neighbors.  
       - Shows the status of EIGRP peering, including the neighbors' IP addresses, AS numbers, and the state of the EIGRP adjacency.

    5. **show eigrp topology**  
       - Displays the EIGRP topology table.  
       - Provides information about the best paths and backup routes EIGRP has learned, including route metrics and feasible distances, helping to analyze the routing table and path selection.

    6. **show eigrp traffic**  
       - Displays statistics related to EIGRP traffic.  
       - Provides insights into EIGRP-related traffic, such as the number of packets sent/received, which can be helpful in diagnosing performance issues or unusual traffic patterns.

    7. **show route all eigrp**  
       - Displays all EIGRP routes in the routing table.  
       - Useful for viewing all the routes that have been learned via EIGRP and analyzing the routing table for EIGRP-specific paths.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all router eigrp** command shows the full configuration of EIGRP, while the other commands provide detailed insights into the operational status, route learning, and neighbor relationships.

    - The **show eigrp events**, **show eigrp interfaces**, and **show eigrp neighbors** commands help monitor EIGRP events, interface participation, and neighbor status, providing a more comprehensive view of the protocol's health.

    - The **show eigrp topology** and **show route all eigrp** commands provide detailed routing information, such as the EIGRP topology and the routes learned by EIGRP.

    - The **show eigrp traffic** command is helpful for analyzing the amount of EIGRP-related traffic being transmitted and received, assisting in identifying potential performance issues.
