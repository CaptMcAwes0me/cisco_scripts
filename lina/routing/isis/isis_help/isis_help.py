       - Displays the complete running configuration for ISIS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System).  
       - This command provides an overview of the ISIS configuration, including router settings, network advertisements, and IS-IS process information.

    2. **show isis database**  
       - Displays the ISIS link-state database.  
       - Useful for viewing the IS-IS database, which contains the link-state information for the network, including the network topology, and helps troubleshoot issues with routing decisions.

    3. **show isis hostname**  
       - Displays the ISIS router hostname information.  
       - Helps verify the hostname of the ISIS router, which is crucial for identifying the router within the ISIS network.

    4. **show isis lsp-log**  
       - Displays the IS-IS Link State Protocol (LSP) log.  
       - Provides detailed logs related to ISIS LSPs, which describe network topology changes. This log can help diagnose issues related to IS-IS routing and convergence.

    5. **show isis neighbors**  
       - Displays information about ISIS neighbors.  
       - Shows the status of ISIS adjacency, including the neighbor's IP address, interface, and the state of the ISIS relationship, which is important for troubleshooting ISIS neighbor issues.

    6. **show isis rib**  
       - Displays the ISIS Routing Information Base (RIB).  
       - Provides a view of the routes that are available via ISIS, helping to analyze the routing table and verify correct routing information.

    7. **show isis spf-log**  
       - Displays the Shortest Path First (SPF) log for ISIS.  
       - This log provides insights into the SPF calculations that ISIS performs to determine the best paths, which is useful for debugging routing issues.

    8. **show isis topology**  
       - Displays the ISIS network topology.  
       - Helps visualize the current topology of the ISIS network, showing the structure and relationships between routers, and is useful for troubleshooting network connectivity.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all router isis** command gives the full configuration of the ISIS process, while the other commands provide detailed operational information about ISIS and its components.

    - The **show isis database**, **show isis rib**, and **show isis topology** commands help to understand the network's topology, available routes, and ISIS database contents.

    - The **show isis neighbors** and **show isis lsp-log** commands help diagnose and troubleshoot ISIS neighbor relationships and link-state updates.

    - The **show isis spf-log** provides logs related to the SPF calculation process, helping administrators debug and understand ISIS's route selection mechanism.
