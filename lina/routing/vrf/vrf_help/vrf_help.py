    Lina "VRF" Commands Help
    ========================

    1. **show running-config all vrf**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration for VRFs (Virtual Routing and Forwarding).  
       - This command shows the VRF configuration, including routing instances, interfaces, and associated settings.

    2. **show vrf**  
       - Displays the general information about all VRFs configured on the device.  
       - This command provides an overview of the VRFs, including their names and associated interfaces.

    3. **show vrf counters**  
       - Displays the VRF counters.  
       - This command provides statistics related to VRF routing, such as the number of routes or packets associated with each VRF.

    4. **show vrf detail**  
       - Displays detailed information about each VRF.  
       - This command provides an in-depth view of VRF properties, including routing tables, interfaces, and other relevant settings.

    5. **show vrf lock**  
       - Displays the lock status for VRFs.  
       - This command helps identify if a particular VRF is locked due to ongoing operations, preventing changes to its configuration.

    6. **show vrf tableid**  
       - Displays the table ID of each VRF.  
       - The VRF table ID is used to distinguish routing tables for each VRF, and this command helps to verify and troubleshoot routing table uniqueness across VRFs.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all vrf** command provides the full configuration of VRFs, showing how they are set up on the device.

    - The **show vrf** and **show vrf detail** commands provide a general overview and a detailed breakdown of the VRFs and their settings, respectively.

    - The **show vrf counters** command helps monitor VRF performance by showing statistics related to routing and forwarding.

    - The **show vrf lock** command helps troubleshoot any configuration issues caused by a locked VRF, and the **show vrf tableid** command ensures the uniqueness of VRF routing tables.

    - Together, these commands help in configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting VRF instances on the device.
