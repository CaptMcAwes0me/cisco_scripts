    Lina "Site-to-Site (S2S)" Commands Help
    =====================================

    1. **show running-config all crypto**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration related to cryptographic settings.  
       - This command shows settings such as ISAKMP policies, IPsec settings, and other encryption-related configurations that are essential for secure communication between devices.

    2. **show running-config all tunnel-group**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration for all tunnel groups.  
       - Tunnel groups define the settings for VPN connections, including IPsec and IKE (Internet Key Exchange) settings for site-to-site VPNs.

    3. **show running-config all group-policy**  
       - Displays the complete running configuration for all group policies.  
       - Group policies define various settings, such as split tunneling and encryption, for VPN connections, including those used for site-to-site VPNs.

    4. **show running-config all interface | begin Tunnel**  
       - Displays the configuration for all interfaces that are part of VPN tunnel configurations.  
       - This command helps identify the interface settings used in the site-to-site tunnels, allowing administrators to verify if the interfaces are correctly configured for VPN communication.

    5. **show crypto isakmp sa detail**  
       - Displays detailed information about ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) Security Associations (SAs).  
       - This command helps troubleshoot IKE negotiations, providing details about the status and configuration of the security associations, which are critical for establishing VPN tunnels.

    6. **show crypto ipsec sa detail**  
       - Displays detailed information about IPsec Security Associations (SAs).  
       - This command helps in troubleshooting the IPsec encryption and encapsulation process, providing insights into active security associations, including traffic stats and encryption methods.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show running-config all crypto**, **show running-config all tunnel-group**, and **show running-config all group-policy** commands are essential for configuring and verifying the cryptographic settings, tunnel configurations, and VPN policies used in a site-to-site VPN.

    - The **show running-config all interface | begin Tunnel** command helps verify the interfaces used for VPN tunnels, ensuring that the correct interfaces are participating in the tunnel setup.

    - The **show crypto isakmp sa detail** and **show crypto ipsec sa detail** commands provide critical information on the status of the ISAKMP and IPsec security associations, respectively, which are key components in the establishment and maintenance of secure VPN tunnels.

    Together, these commands help administrators configure, monitor, and troubleshoot site-to-site VPN connections, ensuring secure and reliable communication between remote sites.
