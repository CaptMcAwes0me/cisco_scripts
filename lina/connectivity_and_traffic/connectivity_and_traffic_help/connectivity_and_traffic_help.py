    Lina "Connectivity and Traffic" Commands Help
    ============================================

    1. **show arp**  
       - Displays the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table.  
       - Shows the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses for devices in the network.  
       - Useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues, ensuring devices can resolve each other's addresses.

    2. **show conn detail**  
       - Displays detailed information about the active connections.  
       - Provides insights into current sessions, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and connection 
       states.  
       - Helps diagnose connectivity and performance issues related to specific connections.

    3. **show perfmon**  
       - Displays performance monitoring statistics for the system.  
       - Provides insights into system performance, including resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.), to help diagnose 
       performance bottlenecks or resource exhaustion.

    4. **show service-policy**  
       - Displays the service policies applied to the system.  
       - Allows administrators to review and verify traffic management policies, including Quality of Service (QoS) and 
       security policies, to ensure the correct configuration for traffic handling.

    5. **show sla monitor configuration**  
       - Displays the configuration of the SLA (Service Level Agreement) monitor.  
       - Provides insights into how the system monitors and measures network performance against predefined thresholds, 
       useful for ensuring service reliability and compliance with SLA metrics.

    6. **show sla monitor operational-state**  
       - Displays the operational state of the SLA monitor.  
       - Allows administrators to check the status of the SLA monitoring process, including any issues or failures in 
       meeting SLA thresholds.

    7. **show traffic**  
       - Displays the current traffic statistics for the system.  
       - Provides a summary of network traffic, including throughput, bandwidth usage, and any potential bottlenecks or 
       traffic anomalies.

    How These Commands Relate
    =========================

    - The **show arp** and **show conn detail** commands help with diagnosing connectivity issues by providing the 
    status of device address mappings and active connections.

    - The **show perfmon** and **show traffic** commands help monitor the system's performance and traffic flow, 
    providing a detailed view of resource usage and throughput.

    - The **show service-policy** command helps ensure that traffic management policies are correctly applied to 
    optimize network performance, while **show sla monitor configuration** and **show sla monitor operational-state** 
    ensure the monitoring of service levels and compliance with performance metrics.
